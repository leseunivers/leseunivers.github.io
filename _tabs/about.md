Hello, my name is Seung Min Shin, and I'm currently a sophomore in the Department of Physics at Ajou University.

<br>

The word 'essence' comes from the Latin 'essentia,' which is based on the root meaning 'to be' or 'to exist'. The label 'esmnce' was created by combining my identity and the word 'essence' to represent the idea of discovering the unique value.
